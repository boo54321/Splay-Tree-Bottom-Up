# Splay-Tree-Bottom-Up
Implementation of a bottom up splay tree in Java 1.8


Run the main function of SplayTree.java

All options are not by numbers and you need to type in the command
ex: 1.insert // input : Insert. // do not give input as 1


# Skeletal Top-Down Splay Tree
 this also depends on SplayTreeNode.java
 
 This code has not been rigorously tested and also only has the basic skeletal functionalities . Once it's been perfected, it might be moved to a dedicated branch or repository of it's own.
